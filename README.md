# Wallpaper_API_App

## Overview
This JavaFX application allows users to browse, view, and download high-quality car wallpapers. The app connects to two APIs(Kelly Blue Book & an image gallery) to 
fetch a wide range of images, ensuring users can easily find and set wallpapers.  

The project emphasizes efficient data fetching, user-friendly design, and maintainable code to support team collaboration and scalability. Development was done using 
UGA's Unix environment (Odin) with Emacs for editing and managing project documents.
